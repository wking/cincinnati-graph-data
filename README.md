[Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform][OCP] is the industry-leading hybrid cloud platform powered by containers and Kubernetes.
Using OpenShift Container Platform simplifies and accelerates the development, delivery, and lifecycle management of a hybrid mix of applications, consistently anywhere across on-premise, public clouds, and edge.
Whether modernizing existing applications, developing new cloud-native applications, integrating data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities to achieve data driven insights, or integrating software from independent software vendors (ISVs) and cloud providers, OpenShift Container Platform is designed to deliver continuous innovation and speed at any scale, helping organizations to be ready for today and build for the future. 
The OpenShift GitHub organization hosts many repositories which contribute to the OpenShift Container Platform and [OKD (the Community Distribution of Kubernetes that powers Red Hat OpenShift)][OKD].

## Contributing

Many of the repositories which go into OpenShift and OKD releases have active upstream development.
For example, [Kubernetes][] has [an upstream developer community][kubernetes-dev], and many Red Hat employees are active upstream contributors and [members][kubernetes-org-member] of [the Kubernetes GitHub organization][kubernetes-org]
Joining us in upstream development is a great way to contribute to these projects.

Contributions directly to the OpenShift GitHub organization are also welcome.
The OKD project has [contributor documentation][OKD-contributor], and individual repositories will also include contributor documentation like [this][installer-contributor].
Current Red Hat employees may also join the OpenShift GitHub organization as described [in this internal documentation][org-onboarding].
